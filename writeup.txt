This is just general thoughts
- ensured that html5 is semantic
- double space instead of tab spacing for webpage
- included width metadata for phones tablets 
- 25.03.2018
	- decided to try to use CSS flexobx to organise layout as 
		- table is a inflexible bad way of doing it
		-frameworks like bootstrap are as good for learning how to make
		a webpage
		-css floats are not very flexible 
	- found flexbox could only align in columns 
	- decided to attempt css grid as it allows 2d layout
